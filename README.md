# Portfolio-Website-Testing-using-Selenium
📖 Description:

This project showcases a multi-page portfolio website developed for a team as part of a DevOps web development assignment. The website highlights individual profiles, skills, and roles of team members — each with a dedicated HTML page.

A Python automation script (portfolio.py) is included, which uses Selenium WebDriver (Chromedriver) to automatically open and test each webpage, capturing screenshots as output for validation.
This project demonstrates frontend design, browser automation, and DevOps testing integration principles.
